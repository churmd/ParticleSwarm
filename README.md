# ParticleSwarm
A particle swarm visualiser based off of boids flocking rules.

The 2D visualisation shows the particles moving around the environment with goals as green points and threats as red points, the larger circles surrounding these points show the area in which particles will detect the point.

Clicking on the screen will add a goal or threat (depending on what is selected) at that point, can be done whilst stopped or running.

Options for the visualisation are on the right of the screen, including: 
- Sliders to alter the weighting of each part of a particle's behaviour, going from 0-max
- A toggle to select whether a goal or threat is added when clicking on screen 
- A number field to select the number of particles (currently capped at 200)
- A start. stop and reset button to control the visualisation
